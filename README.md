# quote-generator
Followed a FreeCodeCamp tutorial to create a quote generator that pulled random quotes from an array.

Tutorial: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/creating-a-bare-bones-quote-generator-with-javascript-and-html-for-absolute-beginners-5264e1725f08

## Next Steps
It works! Now I need to add some styling, and features (taken from comment on the Medium article):

* The page shows a quote upon initial load, only to replace it when the button is clicked.
* The quote is properly marked up to aid in accessibility. Soâ€¦a wrapping blockquote element with nested paragraph tag and cite tag.
* When the button is clicked, it properly redirects focus back to the blockquote, again to aid users who might visit this page using a screen-reader.
* Optionally, the tutorial lists one other user story: to be able to tweet the quote. Try implementing this functionality.
